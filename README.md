# Flex-Cuckoo Hash Page Tables

This repository contains artifacts of the project on "Evaluation of Techniques for Page-Walk Acceleration".

The artifact consists of two experiments. 
1. Experiments on virtual memory traces to show memory fragmentation (Figure 4 and 6 from the report).
Available in `Page_Table/`
2. Verilog timing analysis between Elastic Cuckoo Hashing and Flex-Cuckoo Hashing.  
Available in `RTL/`
3. The memory trace files generated using the pin-tool on GUPS, XSBench, Seq-List and BTree programs from Mosaic. 
Available in `Trace_Codes/`
